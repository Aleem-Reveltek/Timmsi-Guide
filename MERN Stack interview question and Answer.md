# Interview Questions for MERN Developer Candidate

To ensure that a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) developer candidate is not a cowboy coder and follows proper Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes in an Atlassian SDLC System, consider asking the following questions:

1. **SDLC and Development Process:**
   - Can you explain your understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?
   - How do you ensure that you follow best practices in SDLC while working on a MERN project?
   - Have you worked with the Atlassian SDLC system before? If so, can you describe your experience with it?

2. **Development Methodologies and Tools:**
   - Do you have experience with Domain-Driven Design (DDD)? How does it influence your development approach?
   - Are you familiar with LEAN Agile principles? How do you incorporate them into your work?
   - How do you manage project communication and collaboration? Do you use Slack or Microsoft Teams for Scrum meetings?
   - Can you explain what smart commits are and how they are used in your development workflow?
   - Describe your approach to smart branching and how it relates to tracking issues.

3. **Code Review and Documentation:**
   - How do you handle code reviews in your development process?
   - What is your approach to ensuring code quality and consistency?
   - How do you manage documentation for research and knowledge sharing? Do you use Confluence for this purpose?

4. **Tech Stack and Visualization:**
   - Can you provide an overview of the tech stack you typically use in MERN development?
   - How do you use Atlassian Compass to manage your tech stack?
   - Mention your experience with visualizing diagrams using the Mermaid.js Plugin in Confluence.

5. **Project Management and Tracking:**
   - Explain how you organize and manage User Stories and Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) across Confluence, Jira Tickets, and Jira Product Discovery.
   - Do you use Epics, User Stories, Features, Improvements, Tasks, and Bugs in Jira for project tracking and management?
   - How are Epics related to Goals, and how do they tie into Jira Product Discovery and Ideas?

6. **Remote Work and Communication:**
   - As a remote team member, how do you ensure constant communication and collaboration throughout the day?
   - What tools and practices do you use to stay connected with the team and stay productive while working remotely?

7. **Work-Life Balance:**
   - How do you prioritize work-life balance, and what measures do you take to prevent burnout among team members?
   - Share your thoughts on the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Remember that these questions should help you gauge the candidate's understanding of SDLC, their experience with relevant tools and methodologies, and their commitment to best practices and teamwork.

Here are some suggested interview questions to evaluate a MERN developer's skills and cultural fit for your team:

Technical Questions:

- Walk me through your typical process for building a new feature in a MERN application. How do you structure the code, break it into components, connect the frontend and backend, etc?

- How do you optimize a React application for performance? What are some techniques you use?

- How do you implement authentication and authorization in a MERN app? What libraries/frameworks do you prefer to use?

- How do you handle errors and logging in a Node/Express backend?

- What is your preferred way to structure a MongoDB schema and models? Do you have any best practices you follow?

Process/Teamwork Questions:

- Tell me about your experience working in an agile environment using Jira and Confluence. How did you participate in scrums, document work, etc.?

- Describe your experience using Git branching strategies and pull requests. How many approvers did you need? What was your commit message style?

- How have you researched solutions to technical problems and shared knowledge with your team in the past?

- How would you handle a situation where you realized a task would take longer than originally estimated?

- Tell me about a time you had to collaborate remotely. How did you communicate and stay productive?

Culture Fit Questions:

- What kind of working hours do you typically keep? How do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?

- How would you describe your work style? Are you more of an independent worker or collaborative team player?

- How do you handle stress on projects with tight deadlines? What helps you stay energized and focused?

- What are some things that are important to you in company culture? How does our culture seem to match those priorities?

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these suggested questions! The key is finding a balance between technical qualifications and teamwork/culture fit.
