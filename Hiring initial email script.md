Thank you for applying for the position of Business Development Officer at RevelTek Inc.

If that time slot is unavailable, please request another by sending us an email.

This is a 100% remote job opportunity. Our team works from home. We have a flexible work schedule and work for 9 hours with a one-hour break. Please let us know if that schedule works for you.

If you are interested, please send an updated copy of your resume for consideration during your interview.
Do you have your own computer with high-speed internet access and good audio quality? Do you have a quiet workspace where you can work? If not, please decline this position.
What is your expected salary?
Although it is not required, you could comment on the following:
